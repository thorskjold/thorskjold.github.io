            <div class="text select">
                Stroke is an acute interruption in the blood supply to the brain, caused either by brain hemorrhage or a blood-cloth in the brain. Hemorrhage is surgically treated by relieving the skull of blood, and stopping the bleeding, while blood-cloths are removed with a catheter. The larger challenge is treating the chronic impairments caused by stroke. Rehabilitating stroke victims is a complex process, as stroke causes varying physical and mental impairments.<br><br>
                The purpose of this Thesis is to identify which tools caretakers of stroke victims are lacking, and how their needs can be addressed through expanding the availability and awareness of tools. Providing caretakers with the necessary tools, enables caretakers to provide sufficient care for victims of stroke.<br><br>
                The data consists of survey results from 43 respondents, and interview transcriptions from 8 of those same respondents. The participants were invited through the utilization of social media groups for caretakers of stroke victims, on the website Facebook. Using the program Numbers, the survey results were turned into affinity diagrams. These diagrams were used to inform the nodes for coding transcriptions, and coding was done by utilizing the program NVivo. Citations from the transcripts were grouped by how they describe the needs and tools, identified in the affinity diagrams of the survey results.<br><br>
                The analysis was performed through plotting affinity diagrams as charts, and coding the interview transcriptions. Charts describing affinity diagrams, give an overview of the frequency of responses. Coded transcriptions provide an in-depth description of why and how caretakers are affected by stroke, and how they handle it.<br><br>
                The results indicate that caretakers could benefit, from an expansion of the availability and awareness of existing tools. These tools are provided to caretakers by both the Danish healthcare system, and by other caretakers, such as those in social media support groups and associations. The tools identified were: communication between caretakers, support from voluntary associations for caretakers, professional knowledge of impairments caused by stroke, access to psychological therapy, and coordination of the stroke victimâ€™s treatment.
