                    Data visualizations are used to get fast insight into a topic, to create powerful narratives about data, make connections visible, and to explore, discover and persuade. Analyzing, designing, and curating information into useful communication, insight, and understanding have become essential in our digital society. Data design has become a key component in how we understand our world. For digital design, data visualizations and data-driven design have become essential, but this has consequences. In this course, the students will learn how to conceptualize, visualize and present data but also to understand the consequences of data visualizations. The course encompasses data design as a circular process which moves between a) tools and methods to visualize data, b) the conceptualization of data and data visualization, c) application of data visualization and interpretation, and d) addressing its consequences. By understanding data design as a socio-technical process, the students will critically dissect data visualizations to explore their inherent social, ethical and cultural consequences.

                    Design and deliver a simple, explorative visualisation based on the Tr√¶er, basisregister ("Trees, basic registry") dataset, provided by Copenhagen Municipality and available as a CSV file. You may create a more detailed design brief to guide your work, but you do not need to hand it in.<br><br>
                    <i>Visualization explanation</i><br>
                    Mapping trees onto a projection of the city of Copenhagen, allows us to visualize their geographic locations relative to the layout of the city. Annotating the mapped trees with a color for each type of location, emphasizes the relative presence and grouping of types of locations. This is especially interesting, as a relatively large amount of trees are non-registered, and of these non-registered trees, many are in close geographic proximity.

                    "While over 2 million people have downloaded the official Danish COVID-19 contact tracing app smitte|stop, people struggle with prolonged social distancing. The app developers think that a redesign of the app might help to put an end to this menace. They ask for your help.<br><br>
                    Using COVID-19 data from Statens Serums Institute (variable names in the CSV files are in Danish, co-operate with your semester team or use Google Translate), re-design smitte|stop by introducing one or more data visualization elements to it's frontpage and/or to first subpage titled Daily Update. Alternatively you can design an on-screen notification with a relevant data visualization."<br><br>
                    <i>Redesign explanation</i><br>
                    The current Daily Update page, accessible through the Smittestop application's frontpage, fails to present information that is geographically relevant to its users. Instead, the current Daily Update page presents the sum of all positive COVID-19 cases across Denmark. To correct this shortcoming, I proposed presenting positive COVID-19 cases by municipality mapped onto a Mercator projection of Denmark.<br><br>
                    This redesign is expected to motivate users to socially distance, even when the positive cases rapidly decrease in their local area. This is achieved by presenting the mapped data as annotations scaled and colored by their relative case count. Presenting municipality cases in this way emphasises the threat of COVID-19 not only in the local area, but also in surrounding municipalities.
